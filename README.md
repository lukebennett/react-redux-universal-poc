react-redux-universal-poc
--------------------------

Proof of concept universal JavaScript app using React, Redux and [react-router-redux](https://github.com/rackt/react-router-redux).

## Notes

- The app doesn't do anything meaningful - it's just a proof of concept
- Uses react-stamp to compose React components - https://github.com/stampit-org/react-stamp
- Makes full use of ES6 via babel
- Buyer beware! This is very much a work in progress and will be used as a playground for testing further concepts

## Usage

```js
npm start

```
