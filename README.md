react-redux-universal-poc
--------------------------

Proof of concept universal JavaScript app using React, Redux and [react-router-redux](https://github.com/rackt/react-router-redux).

## Notes

- The app doesn't do anything meaningful - it's just a proof of concept
- Uses react-stamp to compose React components - https://github.com/stampit-org/react-stamp
- Makes full use of ES6 via babel
- Buyer beware! This is very much a work in progress and will be used as a playground for testing further concepts

## Usage

Uses the [config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) module for handling configuration - view its readme for details on how to configure the app to your environment.

```js
npm start

```

## Credits

The bulk of this approach is based on the blog posts and work of [James Long](http://jlongster.com/blog) which was very helpful, especially [his blog repository](https://github.com/jlongster/blog/blob/master/server/app.js).
